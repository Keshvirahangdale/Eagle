                <h2>Winged Predator</h2>
                <p> <b>The Eagle</b>, a symbol of strength and rebirth, lives one of the most extraordinary lives in the animal kingdom. At around 40 years of age, when its beak becomes curved, talons weak, and feathers heavy, the eagle faces a life-defining choice: die or be reborn. In a painful process of transformation, it flies to the highest mountain peak, isolates itself, and begins its renewal. It breaks its old beak against the rocks, plucks out its worn feathers, and endures hunger in solitude. For months, the eagle waits—silent, vulnerable, and determined. When the new beak grows, it tears out the old talons and lets new ones take their place. With time, new feathers emerge, and the eagle soars again, reborn with renewed strength. In this remarkable journey, the eagle lives not just one, but <b>two powerful lives within a single lifetime</b>—a true testament to endurance, sacrifice, and transformation.</p>
